This project was created by running: `npm create vite@latest todo_app -- --template react`

To get set up:
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`, and visit the url it gives you

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)



ADOPTION HYPE APP

I created this application so that animal shelters can use it at events to promote the adoption of animals without discrimination. We often see people very enthusiastic about adopting "any" pet, but they are predisposed to or looking for a specific breed. While we can't intervene in everyone's situation and preferences, I believe we can try to reduce this type of discrimination.


# PLAN

- Divide the project into several components (Card, Header, Pets, User) to facilitate execution.
- Each component will connect with its own CSS file.
- Card: This section contains the buttons for user interaction.
- Header: Contains the title and subtitle.
- Pets: Contains the API information once the user presses the buttons.
- User: Contains the input field for the user to enter their name.

Each component musts
-Header must have Title 'h1', message 'p'
-Footer must have message 'p', default message "Copyright © 2023 My Website. All rights reserved."
-TodoList must have
    -Shoud be displayed as a list
    -each item should have its own checkbox and text
    -button to remove the items from the list
-Cards must have title 'h2', subtitle 'h3', content 'p', image 'img'

# Plan execution

Using another assignment as a base, I imported all the new components created for this app, added 'useEffect'
 to synchronize the APIs (I used 3 in total), and added the component constants. I returned a simplified sample
of the components to make the document look cleaner.
